# Entrepreneurial Project ; STAMINA
> 3-month project between July and September 2019 

As part of the Sun Heat IMT Starter Summer Pre-Incubation Program, our team of 4 engineering students worked on **Stamina** - a revolutionary coaching app for runners. The solution consisted in extracting data collected from smartwatches and applying machine learning algorithms.

Within the incubator, many workshops and coaching were provided to support us in the development of our startup.
We worked on both the business and technical development of the solution : 
Web-scraping, Clustering, Reinforcement Learning
